Because in ResNet-50 if the layers after 20th layer are f(x) = x, then it is the same as RestNet-20! So we can make sure f' (the best we can get in ResNet-50 for certain data) will be better than f (ResNet-20 on the same data) or at least the same.\n",

    "   - Too many of this layer will cause the dimeansion too big, so we need some layer to reduce it. **Translation** layer use 1 * 1 conv to reduce channel and avgpool to half the H and W.\n",

    "   - AnyNet: network with **stem** -> **body** -> **head**.\n",
    "   - Distrubution of net: $F(e,Z)=∑_{i=1}^{n}1(e_i<e)$, use this empirical CDF to approximate $F(e, p)$, $p$ is the net arch distrubution. $Z$ is a sample of net sample from $p$, if $F(e, Z_1) < F(e, Z_2)$ then we say $Z_1$ is better, it's parameters are better.\n",

    "\n",
    "梯度检查点（Gradient Checkpointing，也叫 Checkpointing 或 Recomputation）是一种在训练深度神经网络时用来**节省内存**的技术，尤其在网络非常深或批量大小（batch size）较大时非常有用。它的核心思想是：在内存有限的情况下，通过牺牲一些计算时间来减少存储激活值（中间输出）的内存需求。下面我将详细解释它的原理、实现方式以及优缺点。\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 背景：为什么需要梯度检查点？\n",
    "在深度神经网络的训练中，反向传播需要用到前向传播时每一层的激活值。这些激活值通常会被存储在内存中，以便在计算梯度时直接使用。然而：\n",
    "- 对于深层网络（比如 ResNet-101、Transformer 等），层数非常多，激活值的内存占用会变得非常大。\n",
    "- 当批量大小增加时，激活值的存储需求进一步线性增长。\n",
    "- 如果显存（如 GPU 内存）不足，可能无法训练模型，或者只能使用很小的批量大小，影响训练效果。\n",
    "\n",
    "梯度检查点的目标是通过**不存储所有激活值**，而是在需要时重新计算它们，从而大幅减少内存占用。\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 基本原理\n",
    "正常情况下，训练一个神经网络的过程是：\n",
    "1. **前向传播**：从输入到输出，计算每一层的激活值并存储。\n",
    "2. **反向传播**：利用存储的激活值和损失函数的梯度，计算每一层参数的梯度。\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 普通训练\n",
    "1. 前向传播：计算并存储所有层的激活值 \\( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 \\)。\n",

    "#### 使用梯度检查点\n",
    "假设我们选择 \\( L_2 \\) 和 \\( L_4 \\) 作为检查点：\n",

    "   - 计算 \\( L_1 \\rightarrow L_5 \\)，但只保存检查点的激活值 \\( A_2 \\) 和 \\( A_4 \\)。\n",
    "   - 其他层的激活值 \\( A_1, A_3, A_5 \\) 在前向传播后被丢弃。\n",
    "   - 内存需求：仅存储 \\( A_2 \\) 和 \\( A_4 \\)，即 \\( 2M \\)。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **反向传播**：\n",
    "   - 从 \\( L_5 \\) 开始计算梯度，需要 \\( A_4 \\)（已保存）和 \\( A_5 \\)（未保存）。\n",
    "   - 从 \\( A_4 \\) 重新运行前向传播 \\( L_4 \\rightarrow L_5 \\)，重新计算 \\( A_5 \\)，然后计算 \\( L_5 \\) 和 \\( L_4 \\) 的梯度。\n",

    "- **动态选择**：根据内存需求和计算复杂度，优先选择内存占用大的层作为检查点。\n",
    "- **理论最优**：研究表明，最优检查点策略可以将内存需求从 \\( O(N) \\)（N 为层数）降低到 \\( O(\\sqrt{N}) \\)，但实现起来较复杂。\n",

    "  - 额外计算量与 \\( N/K \\) 成正比（每个检查点负责的层数）。\n",
    "  - 最优情况下，\\( K \\approx \\sqrt{N} \\)，内存降为 \\( O(\\sqrt{N} \\times M) \\)。\n",
